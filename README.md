# JAVA_LOAN_SYSTEM
This project is a simple Loan Eligibility System written in Java. It allows customers to enter their details, check their loan eligibility based on their bank balance and credit score, and determine the maximum loan amount they can receive. It also calculates the Equated Monthly Installment (EMI) based on the loan type and tenure.
